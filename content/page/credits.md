The *Collegian Magazine* website would not be possible without the help of several outside services and open-source projects. Thanks to the hard work and generosity of the people behind these products, we can continue to publish our work online for readers near and far.

We built the website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) provides our hosting, while [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) helps us manage our content. Sitewide search is made possible by [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).

We typeset the website with two open-source typefaces, [Playfair Display](http://www.forthehearts.net/typeface-design/playfair-display/) by [Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen](http://www.forthehearts.net/) and [Work Sans](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/) by [Wei Huang](https://twitter.com/w__h_). Both are served by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
