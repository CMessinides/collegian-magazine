Breakfast begins long before the first bite. Its pleasures precede the first step into the Great Hall or the opening of those weighty wooden doors. It starts outside, on Middle Path, as aromas — of sausage, of eggs, of bacon — wash over you, a mixture equal parts cozy and intoxicating. Breakfast is as much psychological as it is gustatory.

Just ask Sesame Street. In a skit from 1977, Cookie Monster visits Ernie’s house for breakfast, and Ernie sings a song about all the healthy options he has to offer: eggs, milk, cereal, fruit, the works. Cookie Monster joins in, singing about all that he wants to eat: scrambled cookies, fried cookies, soft-boiled cookies, with “cookie juice” on the side. In a twist toward the grotesque, when Ernie says he doesn’t have any cookies but that he has a frying pan and eggs, Cookie Monster gratefully takes the pan and, to Ernie’s shock and horror, devours it.

Though Cookie Monster shuns the healthier options, his antics fit right into the commonly-held adage, “breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” Most studies tell us that eating anything at all (albeit, maybe not a pan) makes us better-focused students and all-around happier people. Many college students, however, choose not to eat breakfast. According to a 2010 study published in the *Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences*, more than half of all college students skip breakfast more than half of the week. These actions aren’t without consequences — a 2012 study by the Sussex Innovation Centre found that skipping breakfast tends to negatively impact student performance and increase levels of anxiety.

Clearly, the choice whether to eat our morning meal bears great weight. Even something as simple as a donut — what Wikipedia considers a “common, but not serious” breakfast item — matters. At Kenyon, we frequently discuss the food Peirce offers, but rarely examine the intricacies of our breakfast experience. It might seem too mundane for query. But why can’t the common be serious?

Breakfast at Peirce is certainly common: It belongs to all students alike. Simply appearing to be a Kenyon student suffices for access. And if you’ve had Peirce breakfast once, you know what to expect the next time, and the next: scrambled eggs prepared in heaps, machine-shredded or diced potatoes, and locally-crafted oatmeal.

This is not to say that we all eat the same breakfast. We could even develop a taxonomy of the various breakfasts. “The Post-KAC” breakfast would include some combination of chocolate milk, scrambled eggs, and sausage, possibly enlivened with some Sriracha sauce. “The Pre-Exam,” an omelet with tea and a coffee-to-go, may involve the hurried studying of flashcards in the Fusion line. On New Side at 8:30, you’ll be sure to find “The Lit Reader,” an English major’s diet of oatmeal with granola and honey, possibly grapefruit slices on the side, tea in one of the more generous Sustain-A-Mugs, and the day’s *New York Times*. “The 11th Hour,” a half-eaten bowl of cereal, a picked-at breakfast burrito, and possibly a Diet Coke, may accompany a student frantically completing the last bit of homework for their first class. “The All-Nighter Survivor,” with heaping scoops of eggs, hash browns, and pancakes, sustains the dreary-eyed student at last wrapping up a paper or problem set.

Maybe you agree with this taxonomy, and maybe not. Regardless, at Kenyon, most of us treat breakfast as a means to an end, not the end itself. Chocolate milk helps power an athlete’s morning weight-lifting, for instance, and protein-rich eggs are a tool for sharp test-taking. This is not to say that breakfast is insignificant, but that it normally derives its significance from something else. Purpose, rather than pleasure, becomes the motivator.

We fall into the same trap. When we wake up, we are the focus and center of our world. We get out of bed, we rub our eyes, we shower, we brush our teeth, we pull on our socks. These are very private moments, seldom a topic of conversation. Then, something else happens: We relinquish the center, most likely to our coursework or some extracurricular commitment. Thus begins the grind, our day’s work. Similarly, we eat breakfast not because it is good food meant to be enjoyed, but to grind as best we can.

An idea thus emerges that eating breakfast is just a thing we do, not something we do for the experience. How often do you wake up, head to Peirce, load your plate, and enjoy the sunrise? Do you give yourself the chance to eat your breakfast cozily, not worrying about the day’s work? Beneath the beloved PSA, “breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” we might presume that our daily lives are all about performance, perhaps in the classroom or the gym or the workplace. By that logic, the best we can do is fuel ourselves properly to perform the best we can. And that message is, by all means, a real drag.  

We’d be better off adopting a Cookie Monster-like mindset — If you want cookies, eat cookies. Or donuts. Or bacon. The substance matters little; your satisfaction is the goal. Breakfast, especially “Breakfast for Breakfast’s Sake,” is an opportunity to reflect, to nourish, and to sustain. Yes, Peirce breakfast is common. But your breakfast is uncommon. And that might mean it’s a big deal. Serious, even.

As the sun rises on the Hill, it illuminates buildings which will house challenging discussions, residence halls in which relationships will be tested, and an athletic complex where limits will be pushed. As we step out of our beds, being a “college student with a job to do” climbs up our list of priorities, while being a “human being with feelings and needs” sinks. It’s not an easy transition. The University of California, Los Angeles’s 2015 American Freshman Survey found that about 37 percent of first years at private colleges are “frequently overwhelmed” by all the work that they must complete. Anxiety is common, but many students fail to acknowledge their own needs. Men in particular struggle to seek help, but the pressure to present ourselves as sturdy oaks, impervious and independent, is by no means gender-specific.

Many of us use stress and anxiety to our benefit. No sports team at Kenyon rallies under the mantra, “Everything will be fine whether we win or lose.” As students, we often wait until the last minute to start assignments, and the do-or-die atmosphere helps us focus. Many students overbook themselves, exchanging sleep — or breakfast — for one more line on a résumé. This way of thinking is hazardous, but it usually pays off, albeit with added costs. The problem is that we find it hard to love ourselves when we navigate college as a thing to be done well, not a piece of life to be lived well.

During the throes of the 2014 Polar Vortex, famished of sun and warmth, I tried to find joy through validation in academics and athletics, constantly working harder, sleeping less and less. I starved myself of self-love until I gave in and poured myself a bowl of Mallow Oats. More than good grades ever could, Peirce’s off-brand Lucky Charms bundled my soul in good vibes. Mallow Oats helped me put myself back in the center of my world.

The well-known but little-practiced truth is that no one must be impervious and independent. Kenyon has invaluable resources. The counseling center is incredible; the Peer Counselors are angels. But this is not to say that little moments like a good breakfast can’t help, too.

You’re free to dislike breakfast: You may derive your motivation from elsewhere. Maybe you get up because the professor of your 9:10 reshapes your understanding of modern politics, because your on-campus job gives you a sense of purpose, or because your teammates are your personal heroes. Maybe you just get up because you have to. But if nothing else comes to mind, breakfast can be the part of your day that makes starting the day worth it. With the humble promise of hash brown triangles, the trek through the morning’s snow and fog and rain is not a mindless rambling but a journey with a destination.

It’s good to have something, and if you haven’t got anything, you’ve got breakfast. It will be waiting for you, eternally reliable and aiming to please. The most important meal of the day just wants you to feel important, too.

Now help yourself to a donut. They’re delicious.
